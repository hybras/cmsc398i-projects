= Project 3

NOTE: Using literally everything we learnt so far

== Problems

. Run `uname -a` locally (on your computer) and on grace. Compare/contrast the output. Explain what `uname` does, and how scripts might use `uname` (think back to the homebrew script in project 2 (script analysis))

. `date` prints the date/time in the local format (for example, in europe, day and month might be switched). Create a custom format string for `date`, and have `date` print it out. Check out the information `date` can print with `man date` (there's a lot).

. Run `head /dev/urandom` a few times (feel free to omit the 'u'). Does it print out the same thing everytime? Describe the file we're printing.

. section 5, 6
.. echo y | tee /dev/tty
.. echo y | tee /dev/stdout

. /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, and /dev/stderr are symlinks to file descriptors. What
number file descriptors are they?

. Suppose I chain a finite number of `tee /dev/stdout/` repeatedly like so:
+
[source,shell]
----
echo y | tee /dev/stdout | tee /dev/stdout | tee /dev/stdout | ...
----
+
What formula expresses the number of lines that would be printed at the last tee? (let n be the number of tee calls). Explain your answer

. What is the difference between `sort -u` and `sort | uniq`? When might you have to
use one over the other?

. Suppose you want to sort a file in-place (that is, replace the file with the sorted version).
The obvious command is `sort file > file`, but that wonâ€™t work. What happens and
why? Whatâ€™s the correct command to sort in-place?

. Create a file (of at least 5 lines) that `sort` 's differently with each of `-d`, `-g`, `-V`, `-n`

. Write a grep command for the word "neighborhood". Except it should handle the british and american spellings. Also, I'm a 3rd grader who mixes up a's and e's, i's and y's, and oo's and u's

. Steam is a video game store with a linux client. The Linux client has a startup script (steam.sh) that runs every time the user launches Steam. There used to be a severe bug that caused the userâ€™s entire hard drive to be wiped under certain scenarios. Find the GitHub issue that reports the bug. Also, find the relevant code (either as a link to a git commit, or copy paste the source code). Explain the bug and its fix. (HINT: 3671)

. Prove you can run https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/162769/[`xeyes`] on grace
.. You need an x server (to remotely run gui apps) if you're **not** on linux (so, everyone)
... Macos: `brew install --cask https://www.xquartz.org/[xquartz]
... Windows: You can install https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html[mobaxterm] from the link (and this will work just fine), but I recommend a package manager (scoop, choco, winget). Check if you have moba left over from cmsc216.
.. Login to grace using `ssh -Y` _inside_ the terminal app you just installed. `-Y`/`-X` enables the x server.
.. Run `xeyes`. Upload a screen recording of the app running **with you moving your mouse around** (We're watching you ðŸ‘€).
